                        <h2>Project Information</h2>
                        <p>The National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is $20.5 billion in debt to the U.S. Treasury (Lehmann, 2018), even after $16 billion in NFIP debt was cancelled in 2017 (Horn, 2019). The program has been in debt 24 of the past 38 years and has not been out of debt since 2005. An unintended consequence of its implementation has been the incentivization of floodplain development (Silvis, 2018). These facts underscore the reality that the U.S., and Louisiana in particular, is failing to address flood risk, and economic, physical, and social resilience to flood hazards remains unattainable under these circumstances. 
                        </p>
                        <p>A primary reason that these levels of flood losses continue and that community resilience remains elusive is that the “building code” standard fails to reduce flood damage sufficiently. The 1% annual probability event (APE) flood elevation [aka: base flood elevation (BFE)] is typically used as the design flood elevation (DFE). With no additional elevation (i.e., “freeboard”) to serve as added protection against flooding, the probability of APE being exceeded in 70 years (i.e., the useful life expectancy of a house) is 50.5%. Thus, without freeboard, half of all houses in the special flood hazard area (SFHA; area of the 1% APE flood) are expected to flood at least once, with 12% expected to flood twice, and nearly 3% expected to flood three times. The International Residential Code (IRC; 2014) provided the first nationally-recommended freeboard requirement for single-family homes; however, the Louisiana State Uniform Construction Code Council (LSUCCC, 2018, §103) removed this requirement for Louisiana. There remains no statewide-mandated freeboard in one of the most flood-prone states in the nation. How can we make progress toward resilient communities and economies if mathematics tells us that half of the homes located in the floodplain will flood at least once?
                        </p>
                        <p>The solution appears simple: create and enforce freeboard standards. In an analysis of 450 U.S. communities participating in the Federal Emergency Management Agency’s (FEMA’s) Community Rating System (CRS; Zahran et al., 2010), Highfield and Brody (2013; 2017) found that freeboard requirements in the SFHA promote the most overall cost savings to flood damage, followed by open space protection and flood protection.
                        </p>
                        <p>Therefore, the goal of this project, funded by Louisiana Sea Grant’s Omnibus Program, is to identify, evaluate, and address the economic, physical, personal perception, and policy incentives/barriers to increased freeboard for new home construction in Louisiana and communicate results with stakeholders.  
                        </p>

                        <p>Project research objectives are to: 

                        1) collect freeboard incentive/barrier data from owners, renters, designers, builders, planners, and parish officials and analyze collected stakeholder data to characterize perspectives; 

                        2) characterize flood probability functions at the parcel level considering climate variability across the study areas;

                        3) develop freeboard new construction cost and flood hazard life-cycle cost (LCC) models at the parcel level;

                        4) develop a web-based platform to disseminate economic aspects of increased freeboard; 

                        5) identify potential solutions to freeboard barriers identified in Objective 1 (excluding economic barriers) with assistance from our Project Advisory Board (PAB); 

                        6) widely disseminate project results with assistance from our PAB and outreach partners.

                        </p>
                        <p>The hypotheses motivating our work are: H1) data can elucidate common features that facilitate a multi-stakeholder governance model (for enhancing flood resilience; and H2) increasing new home freeboard is economically advantageous from a LCC perspective, especially as natural processes of subsidence, sea level rise, and precipitation variability continue. The estimated completion time and milestones to be achieved during each year are provided in the project milestone chart.</p>

                        <p>CPRA 500-year coastal flood inundation extent data for current conditions.</p>

                        <p>Flood hazards are highly localized and depend on ground elevation, surface roughness, storage, velocity, and several other factors. Therefore, published research has taken a community- and/or portfolio-based approach (e.g., Hallegatte et al., 2011) that relates overall community losses to flood depths, performed using programs such as FEMA’s Hazus Flood Model (e.g., Dierauer et al., 2012) or the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers’ (USACE’s) Hydrologic Engineering Center's (HEC) Flood Impact Analysis (HEC-FIA; e.g., Bhuyian and Kalyanapu, 2018) software. These GIS-based platforms apply a user-input or system-generated flood depth grid to an actual or estimated building inventory with assumed building floor elevations. Through standardized flood depth/loss curves (e.g., Smith, 1994), an estimate of community flood loss is calculated. For probabilistic risk assessment (i.e., the summation of the likelihood of hazard events occurring multiplied by their respective direct losses), community- or portfolio-level losses for multiple return periods are determined, then fit using generalized extreme value (GEV) theory (e.g., Gumbel, Weibull distributions) to calculate community-/portfolio-level average annual loss (AAL). A similar procedure is undertaken to determine the benefit of flood hazard mitigation, with or without aspects of probabilistic risk assessment.</p>
                        <p>Our proposed approach represents a radical departure from community-level risk assessment as it analyzes buildings and flood exposures (i.e., flood elevation/ return period relationship) for an individual point, allowing consideration of building-level mitigation and decision making for points in space, which are then aggregated for a community. The following flood surface/depth data have been collected:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li> Coastal flood model data developed by and used in support of Louisiana’s Coastal Master Plan (CMP; Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (of Louisiana), 2017) consisting of 57 coastal flood model scenarios which vary by 1) whether or not CMP action is taken, 2) future climate conditions scenario (low, medium, high), and 3) year projected into the future (2027, 2042, 2067) for 50-, 100-, and 500- year coastal flood events (e.g., Figure 2). Model results are continuous across space and thus can be sampled at the parcel scale.</li>
                            <li> 50-, 100-, and 500- year multi-source flood depth raster data for Jefferson Parish, developed by FEMA through the RiskMAP program.</li>
                            <li> Statewide 100-year flood zone and BFE synthesized by Rohli and Friedland as part of the recent Louisiana State Hazard Mitigation Plan Update.</li>
                            <li> It is noted that multiple return period flood data are not available for the entirety of St. Tammany Parish. This selection was purposeful, as the project team will develop and test methodology for parishes with the most modeled flood data (Jefferson and Terrebonne) as well as parishes with more typical flood data (i.e., only 100-year surface and BFE known).</li>
                        </ul> 
                        <p>To characterize the flood hazards within the three parishes, vector GIS parcel and building footprint (where available) data will be obtained from the study parishes and used to extract flood depth values for multiple return periods. For each parcel and under each scenario, either a Gumbel or Weibull flood elevation cumulative density function (CDF; e.g., Figure 3) will be fitted based on least squares using Matlab. For locations without multiple return period flood data in St. Tammany Parish, the project team will work to generalize the results from the other two parishes and test the CDF models to see if they can be used to represent areas with limited data. A successful result here would enhance the applicability and utility of the overall approach as most areas in the U.S. do not have detailed flood data beyond the 100-year BFE.</p>
                        <p>To quantify “precipitation variability” in the historical precipitation data, we will simply examine the percentage of precipitation above or below the climatological mean for that location, and we will also use z-scores to identify the number of standard deviations above or below the climatological mean (1981—2010). For representing outlooks of future precipitation, with uncertainty estimates, we will use dynamically downscaled regional climate model precipitation output from the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP, https://www.narccap.ucar.edu/) and the North American Coordinated Downscaling Experiment (NA-CORDEX (Mearns et al., 2017)). Statistical analyses will be used to assess differences between the historical and future periods. Both NARCCAP and NA-CORDEX are produced and supported by the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. Recent research suggests that models from NARRCAP (Kawazoe and Gutowski, 2018) and NA-CORDEX (Cerezo-Mota et al., 2016) represent extreme precipitation realistically, though Karmalkar (2018) recommends multimodel perspectives for assessing uncertainties in regional projections. Because these precipitation projections do not isolate the timing of the precipitation, including antecedent conditions, so that we can identify changes in the magnitudes of extreme events that contribute to flooding, the model output will be used only to adjust the depth grids proportionately. We will also use the Fourth National Climate Assessment (NCA; U.S. Global Change Research Program, 2017) and other resources that may become available to adjust estimates of uncertainties. At present, NCA projects increases in southeastern U.S. extreme precipitation through the 21st century for both lower and higher fossil fuel emission scenarios, but that after the middle of the 21st century, if fossil fuel combustion follows the lower-emission scenario, the increases will be less.</p>

                        <h4><a href="#">RO4: Web-Based Freeboard Decision Support Tool (DST) </a> <span class="text-uppercase margin-l-20">Example input and output of proposed tool.</span></h4>
                        <p>One of the primary outcomes of the project is a web-based freeboard DST available freely for our stakeholders: citizens, agencies, and practitioners. This GIS-based user interface (UI) allows users to input general building information including an address, square footage, foundation type, number of stories, house relative content values, BFE, flood zone, ground elevation, and new construction cost (or default values may be selected). For a range of freeboard heights, new construction cost and flood hazard LCC models considering user-input data will be returned to the user, including estimated flood insurance premiums, expected annual cost, and payback period as shown in Figure 4. We will tailor the information for stakeholders, who will click a dropdown to indicate their level of familiarity with the flood hazard (i.e., experience with flooding, knowledge about the flood hazard in general) and local community (i.e., existing hazard mitigation plans, local drainage plans, emergency action plans, disaster response plans), and whether they are a public official, home builder, insurance agent, or homeowner. The CRS user groups and community focus group participants will be asked to review a draft of the DST, as will users groups. Researchers will reconvene the focus groups in each parish to present research findings drafts of the tool for comment.</p>
                        <p>We will work with both LSU College of Engineering Director of Communications Joshua Duplechain and College of the Coast & Environment (CC&E) Communications Specialist Christine Wendling, who will assist us in announcing the DST, including on Twitter, departmental/college web pages (with “hit” statistics used as an indicator of the DST’s usage rate/effectiveness), with notifications of the DST to LSU’s Office of Strategic Communications, and with ensuring long-term utility and maintenance of the DST. This effort will also showcase our collaboration with partners at UNO’s Center for Hazards Assessment, Response & Technology (CHART). Because each of the three parishes that we will study will be represented on the Project Advisory Board (see pp. 9−10), we will be particularly attuned and responsive to the needs of the stakeholders. LSU’s Public Policy Center is also available to guide us as we seek to provide the best information available to our stakeholders. We will produce a flyer about the DST to be distributed to visitors at LaHouse, sponsored by the LSU AgCenter, where visitors can observe a prototype Louisiana home built to withstand the environmental rigors of Louisiana, often using products made in Louisiana. We envision our DST as an effective complement to LSU AgCenter’s popular Louisiana Flood Maps Portal.</p>
                        <p>In addition, this research team plans to utilize the DesignSafe Cyberinfrastructure as a benchmarking tool, which is a research portal for natural hazard studies. The DesignSafe cyberinfrastructure has been built to facilitate transformative research in natural hazards engineering, which encompasses multiple disciplines and bring shared benefits of advancements in cloud-based computation and data analysis. This research team can use Data Depot as a shared data repository for data curation and publication that diverse researchers can get access. The Research Workbench of this portal supporting a web-based interface and QGIS is expected to be used for sharing DST with relevant researchers and industry experts. Since we expect the outcomes of this research study will be a valuable foundation not only for stakeholders but researchers in various disciplines including social science, building science, and architecture, sharing DST on the DesignSafe Cyberinfrastructure will facilitate extended research studies incorporating the results and deliverables of this study, which leads to advanced flood-resilience buildings and infrastructure systems. The research team will use ArcGIS online, which is a cloud-based ArcGIS software with the capability to share information through the web, mobile devices, and desktop apps for visualization and analysis (Esri, 2019). This location-based solution supports an automated analytical method providing economic impact of increased freeboard. The map shared with the public through Map Viewer contains options to switch basemaps, view legend/details, share, print, and measure, and access the economic analysis. The first step for building a custom UI tool for ArcGIS is development of a geoprocessing tool that will be done by either modifying the existing geoprocessing tools or creating new tools using ModelBuilder or Python. By using ArcGIS, we will add a developed Python script and add the UI to it as a geoprocessing tool, including panels and boxes with “browse” buttons, drop-down lists, check boxes, multi-value tables, and others. We will also utilize ArcGIS Python add-ins, which provide additional functionalities for establishing the features of windows, messages, and dialogs. In order to develop a stand-alone application, we will convert the Python script into an .exe file with any utility such as py2exe. For this script to run, the system will have ArcGIS installed on the machine to use the ArcPy site-package installed in ArcGIS (ArcGIS Pro, 2019). As for the custom UI, the research team will consider various Python libraries such as Tkinter (which is shipped with the core Python installation), PyQt/PySide (free Qt bindings), wxPython (wxWidgets of C++ library), and Kivy (a great cross-platform library with rich UI). The detailed user interface and other necessary features for developing geoprocessing tools that can be added in the web map-based system will be designed by surveys and beta prototype implementation with feedback from PAB members and potential users.</p>
                        <p>The map including the user interface will be integrated into new content pages within UNO’s flood hazard site (http://floodhelp.uno.edu), including an economic estimation tool to evaluate the LCC of including freeboard in new construction. The site will also direct users to optimal data sources, including the LA Floodmaps portal (http://maps.lsuagcenter.com/floodmaps/) and the federal Interagency Flood Risk Management portal (https://webapps.usgs.gov/infrm/). The portal and features will be preserved for at least three years beyond the award period, as required by NOAA guidelines and will be maintained for long-term utility according to the feedback from PAB members at the end of this project.</p>

                        <p> Based on the data collected in RO1 and in consultation with the PAB, the project team will explore the validity of and solutions to the non-economic freeboard barriers identified by the communities.</p>
           
                        <p> By that point in the project, the team anticipates having had the experience of thorough literature reviews and abundant discussions with both stakeholders and other academics, such as at conferences, which would allow us to synthesize and summarize the disparate data sources to provide concrete conclusions.</p>

                        <p>Impacts and Outreach: Relevance to LSG Strategic Research Priorities The primary outcome of this project is the increased availability of information and tools to help communities and individuals live more resiliently and sustainably by planning for and adapting to current flood hazard exposure as well as that resulting from projected climate changes. This interdisciplinary project addresses holistically the interrelated ecological, economic, and social challenges associated with building construction practices of sustainable communities in the Mississippi River Delta, given the environmental crises of local subsidence amid eustatic sea level rise, and the impacts of changing climate, particularly extreme precipitation. We integrate disciplinary knowledge and methods from sociology, oceanography and coastal science, atmospheric science, civil engineering, and construction management to address LSG’s Strategic Research Priority of Resilient Communities and Economies. We emphasize the topical areas of community sustainability and climate change adaptation, and LSG’s focus area on environmental literacy and workforce development. Our community collaborative research (CCR) approach couples local knowledge and observation with academic and professional experts to inform comprehensive planning and policy with the goals of enhancing community resilience through more informed decisions and improving outreach through sound science, data, and tools available to local and state government officials, non-profit organizations, developers, builders, and residents. Although increased freeboard is the target adaptation strategy, we anticipate that additional adaptation strategies will emerge from elicitation of the barriers/incentives to freeboard in RO1 that will serve as the basis for future research.</p>
                        <p>Recent work by the research team suggests that elevating a building at the construction stage costs less than 3% of the construction cost per foot elevated, while elevating an existing building costs more than $70/ft2 (e.g., $140,000 for a $200,000 home). When multiplied across the hundreds of thousands of buildings in flood-prone Louisiana, the potential savings and enhanced resilience that could be realized by changing the planning/policy/construction culture are enormous. Louisiana has sustained $200+ billion natural hazard losses since 1960 and received $47+ billion in federal recovery expenditures since 2000 but only $3 billion in federal mitigation funding (Gall and Friedland, 2019). It is clear that the current federally-funded mitigation paradigm is ineffective for Louisiana. Different adaptation strategies are needed if we are to achieve resilient and sustainable coastal communities. Prevention of the disaster rather than recovering from future disasters makes sense at every level – household, community, parish, state, and federal. If our hypothesis (H2) that increasing new home freeboard is economically advantageous from a life-cycle cost (LCC) perspective is affirmed, the federal funding paradigm of elevating flood-prone buildings can be re-examined. In such a case, minimal upfront investments and policy changes could render residents and communities more resilient and sustainable in an economically advantageous and sustainable manner.</p>
                        <p>Outreach and Education Plan: The outreach and education objectives are to: OE1) survey people and groups to synthesize economic, physical, personal perception, and policy incentives/barriers for multiple stakeholder groups; OE2) generate robust scientific and economic data informed by articulation of the most salient barriers to freeboard; OE3) incorporate a project advisory board (PAB) to inform and guide our research; OE4) develop a web platform that describes the project findings and provides citizens and agencies with a quantitative tool to evaluate the economics of freeboard; OE5) disseminate project results state- and nation-wide through outreach partners and webinars, including three national technical standards committees referenced by model building codes; and OE6) educate and train three GRSs in interdisciplinary CCR. OE1, 2, and 4 have been described in the research section but also constitute outreach objectives due to the reliance on citizen and agency stakeholder input. The remaining objectives are described below.</p>
